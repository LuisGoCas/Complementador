Complementador
==============

Complementador a 2 de 8 bits

Input  A: 8 bits number
Output B: A 2-complement 

Even though there's the possibility to do 
this as a big combinational circuit, the aim
of this project is to understand the workflow 
of an ASM and its structural design using a
Control Block.

Project for starting to learn structural Design in VHDL
The proyect contains:
2 Registers
1 Control Unit
1 Combinational Circuit
